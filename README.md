This project contains a csv file that contains population of major US Cities along the years. 
We first create a python file to arrange the cities as per the ranking of population from file "Largest_Cities_CSV.csv"
Then the cleaned csv file named as "Ranking City Population" is used for visualization in Power BI 
The Power BI file is "City population animated"
